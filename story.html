                                                being done by different sector players and how

                                                huge financial returns their businesses make. I foresee a brighter
                                                future
                                                with UNDP Kenya as a partner. Personally, I envision massive expansion
                                                and
                                                increasing production with introduction of new tree species. There are a
                                                lot
                                                of opportunities out there and I will be doing tree growing guided by
                                                research and technology.

                                            <p data-dsn-animate="up">I have a couple of recommendations:
                                                • Post conference meeting with the youth champions within the next 3-6
                                                months.
                                                • Provide more clarity on how forestry youth champions can benefit from
                                                other UNDP projects such as GrEYAP.
                                                • UNDP to keep supporting some of the enterprises; it can be technical,
                                                in
                                                kind or financial support especially to the most potential enterprises
                                                with
                                                reasonable financial returns.
                                                • Linking us to investors who are already in partnership with UNDP such
                                                as
                                                Gatsby Komaza, KEFRI, KFS and Financial institutions
                                                • Letters of recommendation to be provided to youth champions so that we
                                                can
                                                attach when writing to institutions when seeking business and other
                                                opportunities.
                                                • UNDP to support our recognition as Youth Champions/ Ambassadors by the
                                                government
                                                • Youth champions to be considered in the forthcoming tree growing fund
                                                through other grants that UNDP is spearheading
