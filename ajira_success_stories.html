												</h3>
											</div>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up">My name is Teresia Ogamba. Most people just know me as Tess Ogamba. I’m
												25 years old. I recently
												quit employment to work as a full-time transcriber. This would not have been possible without
												Ajira
												Digital.</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												I stumbled upon Ajira Digital program when I had beaten down by life. Being an orphan in
												university, I
												was struggling both financially and mentally. I had support from some amazing human beings but
												there was only so much they could do. I had financial responsibilities that I couldn’t run away
												from. I
												tried to look for a part time job but who would hire a student?
											</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												One day a friend told me about online writing. I
												looked into it, tried and started making some
												money. sometimes Kshs. 800, sometimes
												Kshs. 2000. I was just finding my feet as an
												online writer when I heard that the Ajira Digital
												program was looking for mentors. This was in
												2017. I applied for the position without a
												second thought. Now that I think about it, it’s
												the best decision I have ever made in my life.
												I got the opportunity to transfer the little
												knowledge I had acquired about online writing
												to young people like me. To mentor them and
												learn from them. I also got to make a little
												money from that. I made 5000 Kenya shillings
												as a mentor for the Ajira Digital program. My
												first ever paycheck.
											</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												Transcription as a skill was my saving grace. I
												was able to eat every day while in university
												and cater for my other needs because of
												transcription. I paid for my graduation with
												transcription money and graduated in 2019
												from JKUAT with a Bachelor of Science in Biostatistics.
											</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												In 2019, I got featured as a success story by Reeta Roy, the President and CEO of the MasterCard
												Foundation during the Young Africa Works launch in Kenya. <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/reeta-roys-
remarks-from-the-young-africa-works-in-kenya-launch/">https://mastercardfdn.org/reeta-roys-
													remarks-from-the-young-africa-works-in-kenya-launch/</a> I have had the opportunity to work
												with brands
												like Huawei Kenya, transcribe content for NGOs like ACEPIS and through that able to interact
												with
												content from all over the world.
											</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												Ajira Digital made it possible for me to create my company ItsTessKE Limited through which I
												train
												and mentor young people in transcription. I also give aspiring transcribers jobs. As we speak, I
												have
												more than 12 transcribers that I work with who are able to make money from transcription as well
												as a
												YouTube channel where I educate people on transcription and give tips on how to become good
												transcribers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bDTR5TGr4bk">watch youtube video</a>.
											</p>

											<p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
												My dream is to get more transcription clients so I can be able to give transcription jobs to
												more
												people. I also want more people to know transcription and take it up without fear in order to
												live better
												lives.
