                                                Dayaa Women Group is a collective of women who share a similar but unfortunate story. They are all
survivors of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and are determined to kick the practice out of the
County. Nastehe Abubakar Aftin, the group’s founder and leader are from Hola in Tana River County.

                                                She knows only too well the damage that FGM can cause to girls and women. This knowledge is
borne out of her own experience having been robbed of her innocence by FGM at the age of five. She
painfully narrates how her parents (who were supposed to look out for her) pushed her into the jaws
of an archaic practise that has robbed off women and girls a chance to live full and fulfilled lives.
Things are however looking up for the women and girls of Tana River County. This stream of hope
springs from the County Government’s ongoing efforts to combat FGM through the services offered at
the County’s Sexual Reproductive Health/Gender Based Violence centre (SRH/GBV). This centre is a
place of refuge for countless women and girls who suffer at the hands of the men in their lives.

                                                The Sexual Reproductive Health /Gender Based Violence centre in Tana River County is ran by
Hawa Abdulghafoor, the County SRH/GBV Focal Person, who echoes the grim GBV picture painted
by Nastehe.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                “My passion for the field is what motivated me to fight relentlessly for over a year and a half until the
SRH/GBV centre became operational,” Hawa says.

                                            <p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
                                                According to Hawa, the highest incidences of GBV cases in Tana River County are sexual in nature.
These cases mostly feature parental or sibling incest and defilement and are largely attributed to
young girls getting left behind by mothers who separate from their husbands.
“I remember the case of two young girls, aged 9 and 13, who had endured sustained defilement at the
hands of their father after their mother left. It was not until much later that the older one confided in
her teacher and their plight was uncovered,” Hawa recounts pitifully.
                                            </p>

                                            <p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
                                                The operationalization of the SRH/GBV centre, aptly dubbed a ‘One Stop Shop,’ has provided the
much-needed pillar for victims who receive a variety of services. These victims are faced with plenty
of challenges most of which are physical and psychological.
“We have a Clinician, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Gender Officer, and the HIV testing and counselling
staff,” Hawa says.
                                            </p>

                                            <p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
                                                However, with the potential legal trouble that perpetrators of GBV face, some resort to threats aimed
at Hawa and her team while some attempt to bribe their way out of such situations.
“I remember very well they came up to my house. This was a 6-year-old girl defiled by her uncle. Two
gentlemen came with the victim’s mother. They offered me KSh. 200,000 and urged me to turn a blind
eye to the crime. But I said no. I was going to do my job the right way,” Hawa reveals.
                                            </p>

                                            <p data-dsn-animate="up" class="mt-4">
                                                Hawa is, grateful for the support that the centre has and continued to receive from the County
Government through the County Reproductive Health Office. Hawa’s rallying call is for leaders at all
levels, to live up to the obligations of their positions by providing exemplary leadership and services to
fellow citizens.
